Then I started to think through the problemset with my table group and how exactly we could only use arrays and lists but we couldn't really think of anything that stuck. |
| November 2 |  4:00-5:00  | I realized that I had never shared the project to github so I did that. I continued to think about the problem set and then I realized that one possible solution to the problem could be by using something very similar to tries. What if, you do the same thing where if the item comes before you put it to the left, and if it comes to the right than you move it to the right so you have individual node values. But the difference is that instead of breaking it up into individual letters of the word, you just go straight from the number or from the entire key. Each node can keep track of where its two children are, to its right and to its left. Then, I started thinking a key flaw which is that when you added them like if you added A, B, then C. It would be A connected to B connected to C. But if you can shift it around so that the B is in the middle and A and C are connected to it then it'll allow for faster look-up times. I think its similar to weight balancing and its something I might want to try and implement but I'm not completely sure. |
| November 3 |  9:10-9:55  |                          In class, we went over the problem set more and from my understanding, if we use an arraylist and we calculated a unique hash value for each UPC code and then we stored them in an array we would have a maximum of 8,000,000 bytes used which is just 8 MB. Therefore if we calculate unique values, then we don't need the weight balancing at all because we already have constant time lookups. The issue for this is that a collision could be bad for this code because each unique value maps to a very specific product. Therefore to handle collisions, you could have an arraylist of arraylists. Each arraylist in the arraylists has a unique index and because the amount of collision would be so small you could just loop through that arraylist quickly to get the right value. To summarize, you have an arrayList of arrayLists. Each arrayList is an arrayList of nodes and each node has a key, and a value. When talking to Mr.Blick he approved of the idea so tonight, I'm planning on coding out the first function for this algorithm. |

I decided to reuse the polynomial rolling hash function that we used from last time because I know that it's efficient and works well. |
